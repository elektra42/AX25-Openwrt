# AX25-Openwrt

AX25 packages for Openwrt -- ax25-tools and libax25. 

I use them to do IP-based wireless mesh networking with **batmand** (old school Layer 3 version of B.A.T.M.A.N.) with HC-12 serial RF transceiver modules.

At the moment, AX25 kernel support has to be added manually using the **make kernel_menuconfig** menu.
